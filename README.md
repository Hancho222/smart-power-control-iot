IoT-based Smart Power &amp; Control Monitoring System (EE Portfolio Project)
# ⚡ Smart Power & Control IoT Monitoring System

## 🔍 Problem Statement
In small-to-medium industrial environments and server rooms, there is often **no affordable real-time monitoring and control system** for electrical and thermal parameters.  
This leads to:
- Delayed detection of abnormal conditions (overcurrent, overheating)
- Energy waste and unnecessary costs
- Potential equipment damage due to a lack of an automated response

## 🎯 Project Goal
To build a **low-cost, end-to-end IoT monitoring and control system** that integrates:
- Current & temperature sensing
- Microcontroller-based data acquisition
- IoT communication (MQTT/HTTP)
- Cloud dashboard visualization (Grafana/InfluxDB)
- Automatic control logic (fan/motor actuation, anomaly detection)
